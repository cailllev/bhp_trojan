# BLACK HAT PYTHON
## Description
- download the modules from this GitHub repo to the target
- imports them at runtime 
- calls the run method in the imported modules against the target
- uploads the results of these modules

## Usage
run git_tojan.py on target

## TODO
- Test scripts
- Importer works only with own modules, all modules used in own have to be imported in main -> write logic to read dependencies in modules and import them in main automatically
- Add more modules for more exploits...
- Add Sandbox Detection from "Black Hat Python"
